# Web personal dictionary with quizzes

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Distinctiveness
My project fulfills the distinctiveness requirement as it is an online dictionary with quizzes feature. 
There are no links to either an auction, social network, or online delivery website.

### Complexity
This project is more complex than any of these that are part of CS50W.
Complexity underlies in these features:
- Translation API to which request is made, utilizing json and request built-in python modules
- Edit, translation, and delete features are implemented with ajax using JavaScript
- In order to display the country flag custom template filter is created and loaded to templates that display flags.
- Questions for quizzes are randomly chosen, and quantity of questions correlates with the chosen difficulty
- Each answer is checked, check feature is user-friendly (in a case when there are multiple words with the same translation, if user's answer fits any of these, it's deemed correct)
- Quiz score evaluation
- Display reports for all finished quizzes
- Created complex models relationship including models with choice options.
- Use of Model forms
- Using .env file to not reveal private API_KEY

## Models

### NewWord model
- Basic fields user, timestamp
- CharFields that contain word information: text(word in source language), translation(word in target language) and translation edited (by default same as translation, changed in case word is edited later). sourceLanguage and targetLanguage are also charFields with choices argument that contains a list of all supported languages. 
- Has __str\_\_ method

### Quiz model

- Questions and answers are many-to-many fields that connects quiz to words(questions) and answers
- Difficulty field, used to determine amount of questions, has choices arg with models.InetegerChoices 
- Score, field to show how many question user answered correctly, Null in case quiz wasn't submitted.
- Basic fields user, timestamp
- __str\_\_ method
- Added Meta class to change "Quizs" to "Quizzes" in the admin site.

### Answer model

- text char field that contains the answer itself
- question foreign field that connects answer with respective question
- correct boolean field, false by default. Changed to true in case answer.text is correct
- __str\_\_ method

## JavaScript

Edit, translation, and delete buttons that are visible on each added word are all using js. Edit and delete buttons imply ajax requests. Translation button adds default translation which is useful in case user edited that word. JavaScript is also used in \<script\> tag of quizReport.html in order to give red background color to questions answered wrong
